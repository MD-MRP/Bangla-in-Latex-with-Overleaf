### Changing Compiler from Overleaf
* Sometimes for certain languages, classes and packages it may be necessary to use a different compiler like xelatex than the default pdflatex. We have to set XeLatex instead of PdfLatex for using fontspec package.
	* To change the compiler, simply click into the left hand menu and Click on the Compiler menu under Settings
